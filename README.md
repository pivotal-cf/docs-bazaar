## Style Guide

This is a word list for terminology and word usage specific to the KSM for docs.

| Word | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| KSM |Acronym for Container Services Manager|
| <%= vars.product_short %> CLI | CLI component for VMware Enterprise PKS. Unless you are referring to what it is called on VMware Network, Container Services Manager CLIs or [OPERATIING-SYSTEM] for KSM, use KSM CLI.|
|cf marketplace| Generally, the Services Marketplace, or the Marketplace, should not be referred to in this doc. App developers do not interact with the Marketplace. They interact with `cf marketplace`.|
|private container registry| Container registries can be public or private. VMware recommends using **private** conatiner registries. |
|public container registry| If you mean "public container registry" or "private container registry" say so, at least on first use in the paragraph. Don't assume that the reader/learner knows which you mean. Don't shorten to "public registry" or "private registry". |
