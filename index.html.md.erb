## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

<%= vars.product_short %> requires the following:

* **KSM CLI:** For information about installing the KSM CLI, see
[Install the KSM CLI](./installing.html#ksm) .
* **<%= vars.pas_full %> Deployment:** A running <%= vars.pas_full %> deployment with runtime CredHub enabled that is installed on the
same foundation as <%= vars.product_short %>.
For instructions about enabling CredHub, see [Securing Services Instance Credentials with Runtime CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/opsguide/secure-si-creds.html).
* **Kubernetes Cluster:** A running Kubernetes cluster. <%= vars.product_short %> supports Enterprise PKS clusters. For information
about Enterprise PKS, see [Pivotal Container Service (PKS)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/index.html).
* **PKS CLI (optional):** If you use an Enterprise PKS cluster, you must install
the PKS CLI. For information about installing the PKS CLI,
  see [Installing the PKS CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/installing-pks-cli.html).
* **Private Container Registry (optional):** You need this to manage container images
in air-gapped environments.
