This topic describes how to install and configure <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).

##<a id='ksm'></a>  Install the <%= vars.product_short %> CLI

To install the <%= vars.product_short %> (Command Line Interface)CLI:

1. Log in and navigate to **<%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>)** in
[<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Click **<%= vars.product_cli %>** and download the CLI for your operating system.

1. Rename the downloaded binary file to `ksm`.

1. If you use MacOS or Linux, make the <%= vars.product_short %> binary act as an executable file by running the following command:

    <pre class="terminal">chmod +x ksm</pre>

1. Move the binary file into your `PATH`.
If you use MacOS or Linux, move the binary file into your `PATH` by running the following command:

    <pre class="terminal">mv ksm /usr/local/bin/ksm</pre>

##<a id='install'></a> Download and Install the Tile

To add <%= vars.product_short %> to <%= vars.ops_manager %>:

1. Log in and download the <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>) tile from
[<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/).

1. Navigate to the **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard** where
you have installed <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>).
<%= vars.product_short %> registers itself with the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>
marketplace and therefore must be installed in an environment with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

1. Click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under **Import a Product**, click **+** next to the version number of <%= vars.product_short %>.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly-added **<%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>)** tile to open its configuration panes.

## <a id="configure"></a>Configure the Tile
Follow the steps below to configure <%= vars.product_short %> service.


###<a id='az-networks'></a> Configure AZs and Networks

Follow the steps below to select an availability zone (AZ) to run the
service broker and to select networks.

 1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**

 1. Configure the fields as follows:
   <table>
     <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ that you want the singleton VMs to run in.
            This selection does not affect <%= vars.product_short %>.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select additional AZs.
            This selection controls the regions in which <%= vars.product_short %> is deployed.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the same network you use for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component VMs.
          To view the network <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> component VMs use, navigate to <strong><%= vars.ops_manager %></strong> >
          <strong><%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>)</strong> > <strong>Assign AZs and Networks</strong>.
        </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the network or its IP address
       after they are assigned your deployment fails. For more information,
       see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/changing-ips.html">Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment</a>.
     </p>

 2. Click **Save**.

### <a id="storage"></a> Configure Storage

<%= vars.product_short %> requires S3-compatible buckets to store offered charts and the chart cache.
The operator is responsible for backing up this bucket.
Follow the instructions from your IaaS provider.

If you use a cloud storage provider that does not natively support S3 buckets,
you must configure your cloud storage to be compatible with S3 to use <%= vars.product_short %>.
See [Prerequisites](#storage-preq), below.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the storage configurations,
  the service offering data is lost and you must re-add the service offering to <%= vars.product_short %>.
  For offerings with multiple versions provisioned, the old versions should also be re-added.
  See <a href="./using.html#add">Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %></a>.
</p>

#### <a name="storage-preq"></a> Prerequisites

To configure your cloud storage provider for <%= vars.product_short %>:

+ **Create a policy and an access key for your cloud storage provider:**
Policy creation varies depending on your cloud storage provider.
VMware recommends that this account only be used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
You should apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your S3 store.
The policy must give <%= vars.product_short %> permissions to list and upload buckets.
For instructions on how to create a policy and access key, see your provider's documentation.

+  **If you are using Google Cloud Storage (GCS),
you must generate a developer key for GCS to use an S3 compatible API:**
This developer key is used to configure **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in the table below.
For instructions on how to generate a developer key,
see [Managing developer keys for a simple migration](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/migrating#keys) in the GCP documentation.

#### <a name="storage-ksm"></a> Configure Storage in <%= vars.product_short %>

To configure storage in <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Navigate to **<%= vars.ops_manager %>** > **<%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>)** > **Storage Configuration**.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table class="nice">
    <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Instructions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Endpoint</strong></td>
      <td>Enter the S3-compatible endpoint URL for uploading backups.
        The URL cannot start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. For example:<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>storage.googleapis.com</code></li>
          <li><code>s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com</code></li>
        </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Region</strong></td>
        <td> Enter the region where your bucket is located.
          The region defaults to <code>us-east-1</code>.
          Some IaaS providers do not require regions for their buckets.
          For example, Google Cloud Platform Multi-Regional Storage ignores this value.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Bucket Name</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the name of your bucket.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Access Key ID</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the S3 Access Key ID.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Secret Access Key</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the Secret Access Key.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Skip SSL Validation</strong></td>
        <td>Select this checkbox if your environment uses a self-signed certificate
          for the storage provider.
          Do not select this checkbox if you use a production environment. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

### <a id="container"></a> Configure Private Container Registry

VMware recommends using a private container registry in production.
<%= vars.product_short %> can then modify your Helm charts to point to images in the private
container registry.
If you use <%= vars.product_short %> in an air-gapped environment, you must configure a private
container registry.

You obtain the values needed to configure the private container registry from your container registry.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the private container registry
  configurations, you must load all container images to the new private container registry.
  You must also clear the <%= vars.product_short %> cache by adding a new service offering or updating an existing service offering.<br>
  See <a href="./prepare-offer.html#images">Load Container Images into a Private Container Registry</a>
  and <a href="./using.html#add">
  Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %></a>.
</p>

To configure a private container registry:

1. Click **Container Registry Configuration**.
1. Enter the **Registry Server URL**.
This is the URL including your private container registry hostname and project.
For example, `gcr.io/myproject`.
For Docker Hub, use `docker.io/<repository>` for the registry server URL.
This is the location of the private container registry that <%= vars.product_short %> pulls images from.
<%= vars.product_short %> uses the hostname to create the image pull secret and the full path to transform image paths.
1. Enter the **Registry Username**.
This is the username that <%= vars.product_short %> uses to pull images from the private container registry.
1. Enter the **Registry Password**.
This is the password that <%= vars.product_short %> uses to pull images from the private container registry.

### <a id="advanced-config"></a>Advanced Configuration

When `Store Bind Credentials` is enabled, bind credentials are securely stored in CredHub.
This setting is enabled by default. For most foundations, you can leave this setting enabled.

Do not disable `Store Bind Credentials`.
Unless you have integration requirements where CredHub cannot be used, leave the setting enabled.
After you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>,
do not change the `Store Bind Credentials` setting.

### <a id="errands"></a>Errands

The pre-delete errand `deregistar`removes <%= vars.product_short %> service offers from `cf marketplace`
and **deletes all associated service instances and bindings**.
This errand is disabled by default.

### <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply All Changes

To deploy <%= vars.product_short %> and apply your configurations:

1. Navigate to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
